# Family Gem
### Create your own family trees

_Family Gem_ is an app for Android designed to manage family trees.<br>
Project started on beginning of 2018.
It's writen in Java within Android Studio.<br>
The intent is that data structure respects as much as possible the Gedcom standard, in the latest versions 5.5 and 5.5.1.<br>
It's strongly based on the java [Gedcom parser](https://github.com/FamilySearch/Gedcom) by Family Search.<br>
Author is Michele Salvador, an italian self-taught programmer and genealogy enthusiast.

With _Family Gem_ you can:
- Create a family tree from scratch, entering names, dates, places, various events, photos and sources.
- Import an existing family tree through a Gedcom file and modify it as you want.
- Export the family tree you created (via Gedcom again) to import in every other genealogy program.
- Share a tree with everyone in the world, let them improve it and receive back the updates to import (new feature since version 0.7.0).

There are 2 modules:
- **app** is the actual _Family Gem_ app.
- **lab** is the _Family Lab_ app, used only to develop new features.

_Family Gem_ is completely free and open source.

🇮🇹 The code (classes, variables, comments...) is all written in italian, because I'm italian and I love to write in my native language.<br>
I know it's not so kind, because everyone expects an english code, but it started like this as an hobby project and it will continue like this.

The APK file is stored on [Uptodown](https://family-gem.en.uptodown.com).
